# newdash

a backup of dash

exists because dash online imploded

reasons unknown but could be pdns/pdnc related

pdns and pdnc are inactive

also, dash is using URL address instead of URL argument.

host//DASH-SWITCH/ON

host//DASH-SWITCH/OFF

previous was host/?//DASH-SWITCH/NEWVALUE which uses file1= as first

argument unless =NEWVALUE, ... in which case .. it becomes a param pair ? idk
