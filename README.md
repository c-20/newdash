# newdash

a backup of dash

exists because dash online imploded

reasons unknown but could be pdns/pdnc related

pdns and pdnc are inactive

also, dash is using GET (URL) actions instead of POST, though

prun should support the importation of file1=//dash-switch/on (note = is invalid for file1=)

why file1=? good question, but it broke down to a URL when //dash-switch=on is the setting

at the moment there is no need, as there are no URL args ... just a URL ....

need to work out how to iterate through POST again to restore that method

also, prevent overflow in POST, in case that's how implosion occurred
